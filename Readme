Hello this is an experiment in which I tried to use a different language in an approachable manner. I know that setting up a tool chain can be a rather excessive endevour and so I uploaded the source code here for review and execution. The whole source can also be found on github where you can easily download it. [https://github.com/Archina/BioInformatics-3]

To execute the programm all you need to do is push the run button atop ^.

The src/main.rs contains all main functionality. Here sequences are read from file align3 and aling1 are read, joined and written into the output folder.

Afterwards the sequences from align3 are used to create a hamming and cartor distance matrix. The min and max value is also stated.

On the bottom of the file src/matrix.rs and well as src/sequences.rs you can find the tests that check for the functionality of the matrix as well as sequence functions.


Please note that I corrected joining sequences of uneven length but did not do so with a proper alignment (for example using Smith-Waterman). I did think reason about checking it against each entry in the sequence but didn't got the time to include smith-waterman in this. As it wasn't explicity stated to join in new sequences with a reasonable alignment I left this out.
